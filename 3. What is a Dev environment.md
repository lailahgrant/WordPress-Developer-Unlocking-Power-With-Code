# Where To Begin?
- **First step:** Setting up a dev environment for ourselves se we can work locally.

**Logical Questions:**
- What is a *dev environment*?
- What does *working locally* mean?

1. What is a *dev environment*?
| Dev Environment    | Production Environment |
| -------- | ------- |
| Separate copy of your website  | Your real, public website    |
| Only a developer can see it | Everyone can see it
| Private | Known as *live*     |
| Sandbox / Playground    |     |
| Developer's work in progress |       |

2. What does *working locally* mean?
**Local** is the opposite of **cloud**.
| My Computer    | Server |
| -------- | ------- |
| Can install WordPress on individual PC  | Where public website files live    |
| Don't need internet to work | Web host company leaves the site on **24/7**     |
| Only you can see it    | Where WordPRess usually lives    |
