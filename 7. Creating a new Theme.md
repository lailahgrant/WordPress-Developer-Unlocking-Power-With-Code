> Create a new theme on our very own

#### Themes are located in ...public/wp-content/themes/...

- Create a folder i.e. fictional-university-theme
...public/wp-content/themes/fictional-university-theme

- Create 2 files in this folder
- - index.php
- - style.css (CSS file name MUST be `style.css`)
- - In WordPress, CSS files do more than just style a page :-
 `WP needs us to use  this file a bit of information about this theme in form of a comment` as follows;

 ```css
/*
Theme Name: Fictional University
Author: Lailah Grant
Version: 1.0
*/
 ```
The theme preview image **`MUST`** be **`screenshot.png`** and it must be **`1200x900`**
